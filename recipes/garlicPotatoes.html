        <li>4 large cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, unpeeled, cut into 3/4-inch cubes (about 4 potatoes)</li>
        <li>1 cup plain unsweetened almond or other plant-based milk, warm, plus more if needed        </li>
